# elm-browser

The purpose of this package is to expose facilities provided by the Javascript
runtime in web browsers for use in Elm.

In order for Elm to use facilities provided by the Javascript runtime in a web
browser, it is necessary to write "native" code in Elm. Sometimes this has
already been done for you, either in Elm's core libraries or in another
package. However, sometimes it has not been done, so you would have to write
the native code yourself. But, writing native code is a little tricky, and it's
inefficient for people to have to do it themselves.

So, for each facility provided by a browser's Javascript runtime, this package
either provides a wrapper in Elm "native" code, or indicates which package
already does so.

The wrappers provided here are intentionally simplistic. The idea is to do as
little as possible to make the facility available in Elm -- any additional
logic or convenience can be supplied by other packages on top of this.

Most DOM modifications are done by `main`. But, there are a few things one can usefully modify
outside of the embedding.
